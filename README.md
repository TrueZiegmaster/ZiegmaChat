<h1 align="center">For streamers by a streamer</h1>
<p align="center">
This program aims to improve the streaming experience. It independently hosts a chat widget that communicates with 
<a href="https://streamer.bot/">Streamer.Bot</a> via its websocket API. 
All you have to do to see your chat in OBS is copy the link and paste it as a browser source in your scene. 
Navigate to the <a href="widget">widget directory</a> 
to see how to work with widget links and custom themes.

# üéÆ Game mode
ZiegmaChat has an extremely useful feature for streamers with only one screen. 
In this mode, a second program window is launched, which can be freely placed anywhere on the screen. 
After customizing its size and position, you can use a special switch to turn it into a gaming overlay.

> [!NOTE]  
> There are games that force themselves to always be on top of everything. It is recommended to play them in windowed mode to see the overlay.

# üëç Credits
Thanks to [BlackyWhoElse](https://github.com/BlackyWhoElse/streamer.bot-actions)
